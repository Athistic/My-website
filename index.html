<p id="introduction">My name is Athenkosi Mamfengu,I live in King William’s Town and  I am currently completing my Diploma in Application Development. I have 2 and a half years worth of call centre experience and from that experience, I learnt a lot about dealing with customers and people in general. I expect to complete my Diploma from WSU in December 2021 and I am eager to implement what I have learned in a practical and impactful manner.

<p>I have a basic understanding of the languages that are required to build a website. I’ve used PHP in the backend as well as JavaScript, CSS and html in the frontend to create a website ,so I'm very familiar with both sides of the development process and I understand and know what would be needed to create a website or application that uses both. I genuinely love tech and everything that this field has to offer ,and I spend a lot of time outside of my study hours to become a better developer through constant research. I know that with great mentorship I can become an asset to the company and really take ownership of my position. I know I can bring some effective communication to this role and I am also a great team player. I can support my team members in the task that they are trying to hit and the goals they are trying to reach and have no problem jumping in and supporting them if there's an area that I can add value in.</p>
