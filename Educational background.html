<h2 style="text-align:center;color:blue"><u>Primary and High school </u></h2>
<p style="background-color:white;">
My educational background began in 1998 at an Afrikaans speaking school called Schornville Primary school in King William's Town.Thiis is where I learned the basics of writing and reading (Mind you, ek kan nie Afrikaans praat nie lol).
In 2001, I moved to an English speaking school called St Christopher's private school to do grade 4 and that is where I eventually matriculated in 2009. During my schooling years at St Christopher's, I learned
a lot about who I am and what I wanted to achieve in life. Sadly a lot of things happened in my life during my years at the school and I went from being a top student
to one of the worst. The major cause of this downfall was a lack of concentration and prioritization. This downfall began in 2005 when I started to drink
and soon after I became one of the "coolest " kids in school. I had become so arrogant and totally moved away from my dreams and aspirations. In the previous years, I had expressed to
my teachers that I wanted to become an IT specialist. Although I didn't know what the scope of the profession entailed at the time, my vision was quite clear and I 
knew that my passion was in Technology. By the time I reached grade 11, I was already a lost cause. My only concerns were parties and alcohol.<br><br> I passed my matric 
the following year and my final marks were quite horrible and that is when reality started hitting hard. I struggled to get into university and because King William's Town
doesn't have an abundance of colleges that offer IT, I was inevitably forced to choose a different career path the following year cause I had taken a gap year. I was devastated,
I kept blaming my high school teachers and parents for not stepping in to assist me when I was underperforming at school, but the reality is that I failed myself.
I kept asking myself how a kid that always got academic awards during his early high school days could fall so hard. </p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;color:blue"><u>Post High school</u> </h2>
<p style="background-color:white;">
I was advised by my parents
to go back to school to try to get a qualification ,so I enrolled at Buffalo City College in 2011 to do Civil Engineering. I hated the idea of doing something that
I did not love, but I kept telling myself that this was a way of redeeming myself. I was so happy to be back at school to the extent that I got 100% on my
first test. I was focused, I was determined and I was hungry for success, but reality kicked in, this wasn't what I wanted to do. It just wasn't me. I left
school after the first semester and took yet another gap year. By the end of that year I was 20 and had no direction at all. The following year my parents
suggested that I go to Damelin college and register for an IT qualification. Because I was young, I was unaware of such private institutions and I kept wondering why they never
told me about Damelin when they clearly knew that there was an institution not so far from home that would offer me an IT qualification. Nevertheless I was very happy with the opportunity and 
I took it with both hands. By now I was 21 and a bit wiser. I knew that I had to make the best out of this opportunity and I was very confident that I would be the best.
<br><br>At the time, I did not know much about software development and I was happy with any role within the IT space. I enrolled at Damelin in 2012 for my year long qualification
and I became the number 1 student. My confidence level had gone up, and I felt alive again. I had passed all my modules with flying colours, but there was yet another stumbling block;
Work Integrated Learning. Initially it seemed as though Work Integrated learning experience wasn't going to be a problem, because one of our lecturers (Mr Peter Pedersen) was 
constantly in contact with the printer manufacturing company Xerox and they kept calling top performing students to work there for a few days a week. The people from
Xerox stopped calling when Mr Pedersen didn't come back the following semester. I tried to go back to the company to ask them to assist with Work Integrated Learning, but
they weren't taking students anymore. I went to several companies in East London and King William's Town in search for a company that would assist me with the experience, but
nothing materialized. I became stressed yet again and lost hope.<br><br> In 2013, I went looking for a company that would help me gain experience and I got nothing yet again.
By now I was done with all 5 Damelin modules and only needed to complete 240 hours of pure work experience in order to get my certificate so that I could try to gain
entry into a university or get a job. I got a call from a call centre in East London mid-2013, but they were only interested in giving me a chance to showcase
my communication skills for a call centre agent job and not to assist with the IT experience. I took that opportunity because I was scared that I would again be
forced to take a gap year. In September 16th 2013, I got called in for an Interview at the call centre. I attended the interview and got the job within an hour 
after the interview. I was happy with the job ,but I knew that I still had a dream to be in IT. A few weeks after joining the centre, I spoke to my employer and pleaded with them to
assist me with the relevant IT experience that would take place after my work shift. An agreement was made, but due to unforeseen circumstances the company had to 
cancel the agreement. I was hurt and by know I was getting used to disappointment. I then learned from a former classmate from Damelin that our certificates
would expire after 3 years from the time we completed the theoretical part. I continued to search for a place that would help with experience and I had no luck.
I continued working for the call centre till 2016 March. I realised that I wasn't happy with what I was doing, although I was getting paid enough money for
a person who had very few responsibilities at the time. I sat out the remainder of 2016 trying to find myself and my drive yet again. I was 25 and very much mature now so I
had to start thinking extensively about my future. I thought maybe it was best to study something else that would get me permanent employment and just forget about
IT all together.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;color:blue"><u>Lovedale College</u> </h2>
<p style="background-color:white;">
 I applied for public management at a called called Lovedale in king William's Town for the 2017 academic year and got accepted towards the end of 2016. In 2017, I
didn't go to Lovedale college, it just didn't feel right to me. By now my parents were under the impression that I didn't like school and this really annoyed
them because I was about to turn 26 and didn't seem to have any direction in life. This really killed me inside because they didn't understand what was so 
important about this IT. They no longer believed in my vision and dream. It was really sad because I knew what it is I wanted to do. At times I felt like a failure,
but I knew that my vision was clear I just needed a chance to fix my mistakes. <br><br>I took yet another gap year in 2017, but I got into a relationship with a long time female friend
and this is where my life changed. She had just completed her qualification at the then Nelson Mandela Metropolitan university but couldn't further her studies
that particular year, so she was to take a gap year and spend the rest of 2017 in King William's Town. By now my vision was just a mere dream. I had little fight left in me,
I felt I could still make my dream a reality, but no one believed in my dream anymore. I remember speaking to my partner telling her how my dreams went up in smoke
because of the past mistakes that I made. I was surprised by how much she motivated me to chase that dream again. She told me so many motivational stories about how
many people from her university bounced back after undergoing the things that I had also experienced.<br><br> The spark gradually lit up and she encouraged me to use
my poor matric marks to apply at Walter Sisulu University. I honestly wasn't ready to experience yet another rejection, so I was very sceptical to apply. I eventually
applied for an IT National Diploma and she also applied at the same University for her post Graduate qualification. A few months later, the university responded to her application and it
was successful. A few days later, I received mine and I was rejected by the University. Apparently I didn't meet the minimum requirement. I was disappointed and
I remember speaking to my parents trying to explain to them that I wanted to try online studying with another institution from Johannesburg, but of course they
weren't so convinced so I had to go register at Lovedale in January 2018. I got accepted to do public management. I just told my self that I would give it 
my all. This was me giving up on a childhood dream. I became a good student and of course I was one of the elder students in class, but this didn't stop
me from trying to salvage something out of everything I had been through academically. My partner really consoled me and encouraged me to do my best and hoped that I'd revisit my 
dream once I was done with the public management qualification.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;color:blue"><u>Walter Sisulu University </u></h2></u>
<p style="background-color:white;">
 February 9th, 2018 is when the door to my dream was finally opened. It was on a very sunny Friday afternoon,
I received a called from Walter Sisulu University. This was about 3 months after they had initially rejected me and by now I was a Lovedale college student for
a little over a month. They told me they wanted to give me a chance in their extended IT programme. This will always go down as one of the best days in my life.
I felt as though I was given a second chance. A chance to finally fix my mistake and fulfil my dream. I have not looked back since, instead I am constantly passing with high marks.
I am doing my final year now and I am currently averaging at 87% academically, and I am confident that I will pass my Diploma with a Cum Laude in my Software Development stream 
come Nov-Dec 2021. </p>
