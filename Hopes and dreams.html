As an ambitious young man, I am hoping to become a successful full stack software developer within a certain organisation. I believe that I have what it
 takes to climb up the ladder and eventually become a senior full stack developer and even manager within the software development space. 
 I believe that I possess a brilliant mind and I am able to solve problems that require the aid of technology. In the forever changing world we live 
 in, new technology and programming languages are created every day, so it is imperative that I try to master as many languages as possible. As
 a man who comes from a small town in Eastern Cape, I am hoping that I shall one day pass my acquired skills to all the children who would be interested
 to learn about software development since it's a very scarce skill in King William's Town. I hope one day I will be able to build an app that will directly 
 contribute to fighting crime in South Africa.
