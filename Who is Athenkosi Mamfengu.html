<br>

<p style="background-color:black;width:35%;">Athenkosi Mamfengu, born on the 11th February 1991 is an ambitious black man who was born and bred in a small town called King William's Town in the Eastern Cape.
He is the youngest of 3 children and the only male amongst them. Growing up, he's always been an ambitious person, but because of the many mistakes he made during
his teenage years and the lack of opportunities in his small town, he has been unable to fulfil his full potential. However, he is currently working towards rectifying
those past mistakes and hopefully fulfil his long term goal i.e. being a software developer. Athenkosi is one of the hardest working individuals who always sees to it
that he puts in a 110% effort in whatever he does. He is goal driven and believes that he has what it takes to become a successful software developer. He spends most of 
his time trying to improve his code and learning new programming languages whilst balancing his personal life and that of his academics. He takes pride in his school work and
constantly treats it like a full time job. A parent to a 1 year old boy, Athenkosi seeks to become a role model to his son and help guide him in his own journey to success.<p>
